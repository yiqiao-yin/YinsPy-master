## Money Management

Having a sound long-term investment strategy as a part of a comprehensive money management plan helps investors keep their focus on their personal benchmarks rather than meaningless market benchmarks or indexes, enabling them to ignore short-term market events. It is about personal wealth improvement.

- As the first section discussed on this site, Yin's Timer is always going to be the frontier pipelines of our products. We are proud to present a beta version of python notebook [here](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Yins_Python_Projects/blob/master/scripts/python_MM_EDA_YinsTimer.ipynb).

- When it comes to portfolio construction, Markowitz is my go-to guy to discuss. Here is a notebook to discuss his point of view of efficient portfolio. Link is [here](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Yins_Python_Projects/blob/master/scripts/python_MM_Markowitz_Portfolio.ipynb).

- The most basic pricing model, Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), is without a doubt an important discussion here on my platform. Here is a python notebook for a quick [discussion](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Yins_Python_Projects/blob/master/scripts/python_MM_CAPM.ipynb).

## Data Structures

Data Structures are the key part of many computer algorithms as they allow the programmers to do data management in an efficient way. A right selection of data structure can enhance the efficiency of computer program or algorithm in a better way.

- An important component in data structure is navigation through different formats of data and information extraction. I actually had an interview about this following question (source is provided by [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=re-applications)): this problem is a derivation of the problems provided by HackerRank (since it is an encrypted interview question, I can't copy/paste here, but I took the idea and provide my own replication of the problem) [Validate and Report IP Address](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Yins_Python_Projects/blob/master/scripts/python_DS_Validate_Report_IP_Address.ipynb)
