    "# Machine Learning: Decision Tree Regressor with Startups Investment Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "We have touched upon the basics of machine learning from previous notebooks such as Simple Linear Regression and Multivariate Linear Regression. Besides the underlying assumptions that these machines are limited to, structures such as non-linearity or hierarchical relationships may popse difficulties for regression models. On top of that, we can only explain our dependent variable on a marginal basis which means we can also what each $x$ affects $y$ individually and we cannot make arguments of how $x_1$ and $x_2$ together create impacts on $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above discussion exposed the motivation for us to move above regression analysis. A standard procedure is to use tree-base learning algorithms. The most famous one is Decision Tree Regressor. In this notebook, we are going to cover the following\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\textbf{Environment Initiation}$. I always start with initiating the environment. I import the correct modules, APIs, and libraries that need to be used for this notebook and I set up my data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\textbf{Data Cleanup}$. Data set cleanup is very important. In real world, not all data are saved properly and it is our duty as a data scientist and machine learning practitioner to ensure that the data is valid and can be processed by machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\textbf{Machine Learning: Decision Tree Regressor}$. Every notebook has a purpose and in this case I want to focus on building a Decision Tree Regresssor in a data science project. It is crucial to have a starting explanation to introduce the main structure of this learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\textbf{Machine Learning: Training, Testing, and Visualization}$. We want to ensure the robustness of a machine throughout the training procedure. We split the data into training set and testing set so that we can ensure the sample used on testing shows the real and unbiased performance of decision tree regressor. The benefit of using tree-based learning algorithm is the power of interpretability. We use *export_graphviz* from *sklearn* to allow python to present the graphs of the machine we have just trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\textbf{Software Development / Product Management}$. Every data science project has two phases. Phase I is about end-to-end research and select the most optimal machine learning procedure. Phase II is about delivering a software product to consumer and clients so that the python codes can be called and there is no need to redo everything that has already been done."

    "Decision Tree Regressor is a tree-based learning algorithm that carries out a prediction problem. Let us start with the notion of decision tree. A decision tree constructs recursive partitioning. The structure starts with a root node, known as a parent. Each node can be split into left and right child nodes. These nodes can be split further down the branches depending on the needs of the data set. Note that in practice you may end up creating many nodes which may cause overfitting. We are going to have to prune the tree by setting up the max depth. After we have splitted the features, we can use regression model to carry out the final predictions."
