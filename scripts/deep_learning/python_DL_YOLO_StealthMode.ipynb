    "- There is no machine learning component coded into this script.\n",
    "- Two components that are important: (i) record the background, (ii) mask the current image.\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) recording is easy to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) now camera is on, there is something (background, person, blanket, objects); we look for a pre-defined *red* color threshold that the picture frame has, if it is detected, we replace this area with the pre-recorded background (this is done in (i))."
